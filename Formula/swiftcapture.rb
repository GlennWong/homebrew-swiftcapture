  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      SwiftCapture requires Screen Recording permission to function properly.
      
      To grant permission:
      1. Open System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy
      2. Select "Screen Recording" from the left sidebar  
      3. Click the lock icon and enter your password
      4. Add your terminal application (Terminal, iTerm2, etc.)
      5. Enable the checkbox next to your terminal
      6. Restart your terminal application
      
      For microphone recording (optional), also grant Microphone permission
      following the same steps in the "Microphone" section.
      
      Quick start:
        scap --help                    # Show comprehensive help
        scap --duration 30000          # Record for 30 seconds  
        scap --screen-list             # List available screens
        scap --app-list                # List running applications
        scap --enable-microphone       # Include microphone audio
        
      Presets are stored in: #{var}/scap/
